# Rock_Paper_Scissors
A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game

At the start, the app prompts the user to select an option between Rock, Paper and Scisssors. 
If the user inputs an invalid option, the app continues to prompt the user until a valid option is selected.
When the user selects a valid option, it is being compared with the CPU selection(acheived by using the choice method in the inbuilt python module, Random).
If the result of the comparison is a tie, the user is allowed to play again. Otherwise, a winner is declared and the game ends.
